                  leaderElect enables a leader election client to gain leadership

                  leaseDuration is the duration that non-leader candidates will wait
                  after observing a leadership renewal until attempting to acquire
                  leadership of a led but unrenewed leader slot. This is effectively the
                  maximum duration that a leader can be stopped before it is replaced
                  by another candidate. This is only applicable if leader election is
                  enabled.

                  renew a leadership slot before it stops leading. This must be less
                  than or equal to the lease duration. This is only applicable if leader
                  election is enabled.
